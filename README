THIS WAS AN EXPERIMENT AND WILL MOST CERTAINLY BREAK SOME WEBSITE SOMEWHERE, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Chrome extension that replaces the word "Comments" with "Regrets" and gives a title warning on associated links.

It is very basic, will replace text you don't necessarily want replaced, and ultimately should not be used if you don't know what you're doing.

That said, it was a fun experiment.
